# Gameplay

This game is a survival, exploration and collecting game. You are the leader of your people, you found an ideal place for your people to settle down. This place has clean water, woods, fruits and animals in the nearby forest. You decided to settle down here and build your hut, hall, warehouse.

And you’ve already known that the goal for the game is to collect as many items as possible from exploring, and send it to the spaceship to get a reward. You need to assign jobs to your people.

In the very beginning, you are assigned a village on the wasteland, with some buildings by default. You don’t have many followers in your village, only Adam and Eve. Those two villagers are the survivors you found on the way here, and they are free villagers given by the system, and non-transferrable NFT, which means you can’t trade them to other players.\
