# Village

When players start the game at the first time, a spaceship village is found on the wasteland, with some buildings by default.

**Portal**: In the center of the village, there is a shining portal, it can teleport anything directly to the only spaceship on earth. Players can contribute the collected items through the portal. All contributed items will be transferred to the spaceship automatically, and players will be rewarded for the contribution.

**Shack**: By default, each village has a hut which can let 5 villagers live in, of course kids also count. If a player has more than 5 villagers, New Shack is required to purchase.&#x20;

**Warehouse**: A warehouse is used to store items. The warehouse is only for temporary use. We highly recommend that players equip the villagers to increase the villagers attributes right away, or contribute items through the portal for rewards.

**Hall**: This shabby hall is the place for some important events, like marriage.

**Shop**: Shop is the marketplace that players can purchase workplaces and tools, exchange NFTs with other players. Players can sell almost all of your NFTs except Adam and Eve. You need to pay 2.5% of the traded value for the transaction fee.

Players may need to purchase other types of foods from other players and sell what he can produce by the workplaces. Choose smartly and trade carefully.

**Magic House:** Magic House is the place to upgrade NFTs, e.g., villagers, pets, weapons and dresses. Adam and Eve are not upgradable, foods are not upgradable.
