# Contribution Pool

The Contribution Pool is a unique design, and also the most important part of the game Tokenomics, it determines how much you can get rewarded to play the game. The design of Contribution Pool solves the problem that itâ€™s hard to sell in-game-NFT, especially the game token price goes downward. The Contribution Pool accepts all NFTs and rewards contributors back fairly, it protects players from losing money and let the game play for a long run.

The Contribution Pool contains 5 element pools: Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. Those five elements are the basic elements for humans to survive, each element pool has an equal and fixed amount of rewards everyday. And a player is informed of the Contribution Points and to what element pool, when he wants to contribute his NFTs through the Portal. The reward is calculated by his Contribution Points VS total Contribution Pools in each different element pool.
