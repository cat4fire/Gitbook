# Contribution Pool Rewards

Based on our WASTE token emission plan, there are 225,000 WASTE tokens awarded daily to contributors for the first 3 years. And each element pool has a fixed amount of 45,000 WASTE tokens to contributors. Everyday, the 45,000 WASTE of each element pool will be distributed to every contributor based on their shares.

Since villager, pet and weapon NFTs are rare, you also need them in your exploration. You'd make a good decision to contribute them, trade them with other players or wear them to increase your working efficiency.
