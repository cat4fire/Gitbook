# Player Identity

**Player Identity**

&#x20;****&#x20;

A player in the Wasteland Settlers has an identity NFT with different colors. Different colors give a player’s villagers different bonuses when they are assigned to a job.

&#x20;There are 5 different colors for Player’s Identity NFT: **Gray**, **Green**, **Blue, Orange** and **Yellow Identity**. The default color of a player is Gray, it doesn’t have any benefits.

&#x20;A player can purchase a **Green, Blue** and **Orange** Identity NFT from our presale or trade his Identity NFT with other players. Green, Blue or Orange Identity NFT will help you grow much faster than Gray Identity NFT.

&#x20;You can also use player’s existing NFT as the profile picture, it’ll give you the **Yellow** Identity. we are currently supporting over 50 different NFT projects like Bored Ape, CryptoPunks, etc. You can get more information in our site’s FAQs.

&#x20;The Identity NFT is tradable, it increases villagers’ working efficiency, but it won’t increase your villagers’ Contribution Points.
