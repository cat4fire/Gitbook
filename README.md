# Abstract

Wasteland Settlers is a Role-Playing game about survival, exploration and collecting. In this strange wasteland metaverse, you lead your people to feed, explore and collect NFTs and fill power into the earth's last space shuttle. Players Play-to-Earn by contributing what is found in the wasteland.

We believe metaverses and blockchain provide players immersed and harvesting gaming experience, with economic incentives driven by fairness and automation.

We identified 4 major problems commonly seen in most blockchain games that Wasteland Settlers will address:

*   **Problem 1 Prepaid tokens to play game**

    That brings risk of losing money to players, we believe free to play model is fair for players
*   **Problem 2 - Similar games and too many copycats**

    Blockchain games need innovation, we’ve seen too many copycats of successful games (eg. copying Axie Infinity), Still, tokenomics is key of success.
*   **Problem 3 - Hyperinflationary and unsustainable tokenomics**

    The popularity of games depends on the design of game tokenomics. Good game tokenomics design will extend the game lifetime, helping players to get more financial returns and keep the game vibrant. Bad tokenomics drains play-to-earn rewards fast as the number of players grows.
*   **Problem 4 - Tokens safety**

    We see founders of a few gaming projects took all tokens and ran away, resulting in all players losing their investment in the game.

We address 4 problems above through our solutions embedded within design of Wasteland Settlers:

* Wasteland is a **free-to-play game**, you don’t need to pay any token upfront to play the game. Everyone is welcome to start enjoying the fun of the game, learning how to play and understanding tokenomics and calculation of ROI. Of course, purchasing tools and chests will help the players to gain more from exploration and rewards.
* Wasteland Settlers is wasteland-type RPG game We are building the wasteland metaverse, players survive in the nuclear-bombed land. **Players don’t need to level up**, simply explore the land and equip their villagers, or increase the power of the space shuttle for launching it one day to find a new planet. Wasteland Settlers is able to **set player profile picture to your own Hero NFT**, e.g. Bored Ape Yacht Club and many other 50 NFTs.
* A unique tokenomics - Contribution Pool, **it solves the problem of Hyperinflationary and that NFTs are hard to sell.** The Contribution Pool takes all NFTs and rewards contributors fairly. Every player enjoys lifetime rewards from the Contribution Pool, the more contributions, the more rewards.
* The future of this game is driven by the community, in which **85% of WASTE tokens are distributed to the community**, the DAO tokens are staked and used based on the voting. The projects will move to DAO model of governance. **The source codes are open and audited**. It’s transparent to all players.

The summary is in below table:
