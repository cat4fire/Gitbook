# Giving Birth

**Hall** in your village is the place for male and female villagers to give birth to a baby. To get the female villager to get pregnant, first provide foods to increase her Happiness. It’s very important since her Happiness will determine the baby’s attributes.

Child Attributes = ((father attributes + mother attributes) \* 50%) +/-15%

That means the child’s attributes are the average of his parents, but with 15% up more less.

The 15% of up or less depends on the happiness of the mother. If the mother has only 14% happiness, then the baby attributes -15%. If the mother has 100 Happiness, then the baby attributes +15%.

So, it’s very important to have various foods before sending the male and female villagers to the **Hall**. Villager NFTs are very rare, I believe this investment can bring you more return.

It’ll take about 20 days for the female villager to deliver her child. The Child needs 15 days to grow as an adult, before that, all of his attributes are only 30%, and even if you send him to the Contribution Pool, it’s still only 30% of his attributes.

Child and pregnant women can’t go exploring, but you can ask them to hunt and pick fruits.
