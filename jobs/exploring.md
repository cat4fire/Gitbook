# Exploring

Exploring is the most important job of the game, it’s the only way to collect NFT items.

Sending the villager out to explore, he will find chests and collect back. When a player opens these chests, new villagers, weapons, dresses and even pets can be found. Those NFTs equipped to the villager will highly increase his/her efficiency to perform exploring and other jobs. And of course, contributing those NFTs to the Portal to earn lifetime rewards is also a good idea.

**Length Attribute**: It determines the Number of events during the exploring.

**Endurance Attribute:** it determines the exploring time, the longer of it, the more chests can be found.

**Luck Attribute:** It determines the exploring success ratio. It’s the ratio to collect a chest when the villager encounters an event. For each extra 2.5 hours exploration, the villager can get 2% more success ratio.
