# Player VS Player Fighting (PVP)

**PVP Fighting** is another way to get rewarded, different PVP ranking gives you different rewards weekly.

Players can send a maximum of 5 villagers to fight at the arena. Click a player’s name in the ranking board and ‘Challenge’ him. The winner will take the loser’s place and the loser’s ranking declines.

The 5 villagers will fight in a turn base, winning depends on the villager’s attributes.

Villagers don’t need to feed to fight with other players, and Happiness won’t affect villagers’ attributes. And working villagers can join PVP fighting without interruption of their current job.
