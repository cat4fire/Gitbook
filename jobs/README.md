# Jobs



There are a few jobs the villagers can do to survive.

*   **Collecting Foods**

    Hunting and picking fruits for getting your food, your villagers can’t do almost anything without food, so make sure you have enough food to live on.
*   **Making Foods**&#x20;

    There are different food types, supplying different food types will make your villagers happy. Your villager wants roast, wine, bread and sausage, they are not satisfied with only strawberries. You need to feed them at least 3 different foods to make them happy to have the full power to do the job. It seems they are spoiled way before the alien invasion.&#x20;
*   **Exploring**

    Exploring is the most important job to do. After you have enough foods, you need to send your villagers to explore the strange wilds. The exploration is dangerous, it’s better to have your villager well equipped. Sometimes, your villagers can find something exceeding your expectations. Your villager may find other survivors,  dogs, or weapons and other items. Those will make your villagers stronger and let your village grow faster.
*   **Giving Birth**&#x20;

    Giving birth is one of the ways to grow your people, send your male and female villagers to the hall and give them your blessing, increase their happiness, and they may get pregnant and deliver a child. It takes a long time, but you need to be patient.
*   **Contribution**

    In the center of your village, the portal to the space shuttle shines. You send what you’ve collected from the exploration, and you will get rewards every day. The contribution, it’s very important to know your contribution points, it determines how much rewards you can get. Of course, once you send your NFTs to the portal, you won't be able to use it again.
