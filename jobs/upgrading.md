# Upgrading

Upgradable NFTs include villagers, pets, weapons and dresses. You can upgrade those NFTs at the MagicHouse.

To upgrade a NFT, 2 same NFT type and same level NFTs are required. One NFT is the upgrade target, one NFT is consumed. The success upgrade will increase the target NFT attributes 50%

The success rate of upgrade will decrease with the level up. The initial success rate is 100%, and each success upgrade will decrease the success rate 10%.&#x20;

Upgrade consumes WASTE tokens too.
