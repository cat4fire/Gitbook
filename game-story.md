# Game Story

The civilization of earth was destroyed by the alien raiders. After millions of nuclear missiles devastated our green homeland then Aliens flew away with robberies of gold and other rare metals. Earth has turned into a wasteland where survival is the primary objective.

Survivors in different places were searching for foods to eat, weapons and dresses to equip, they finally found a small piece of green land to settle down. You, as one of survivors, opened your small magical box, and the light of a space shuttle shone in the small village, it’s a portal to the space shuttle. The space shuttle is your last hope to survivors, it’s the only ship on the earth, launching it by filling power will bring the survivors to a new planet.

As the leader of the group, you need to assign jobs to your people, let them explore new strange places, collect items, defeat your enemies and boost power to space shuttle through the portal. You will earn rewards for what you’ve done to the hope of humanity.
