The **WASTE** token is distributed to the participants of the Wasteland Settlers Community including: Stakers: **WASTE** token holders who deposit their **WASTE** that are auto-compounded at each user interaction. Players: Game players receive rewards daily based on their playing behaviors. Liquidity providers: those who provide liquidity will also receive token rewards.

Some **WASTE** tokens, as part of the pre-minted tokens, are vested by strategic sale participants, the Team Treasury, and the DAO Treasury. These tokens are staked at the deployment. Other preminted tokens are airdropped to those who participate in the presale of the Community Membership NFTs and some randomly selected users of some Play-to-Earn games on the market.
