# DAO Treasury

Tokens allocated for the DAO are emitted linearly for staking for about 307 days (or 2,000,000 block time). For every block time, 35 tokens are deposited into the staking pool. Staked tokens are available for withdrawal at the same speed after 90 days (or 585,000 block time) of staking.
